        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>
          I&#8217;m currently working as a software developer for{' '}
          <a href="https://www.sky.com">Sky</a> in Leeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I joined through the Software Engineering Academy graduate scheme.
          This involved a six month project developing a piece of software in an
          agile team. In our team, we created a digital whiteboard for
          visualising and orgainising development squads.
        </p>
        <p>
          These days you&#8217;ll find me in the Digital Help team programming
          mainly in ReactJS and Ruby. I deal with frontend apps such as the{' '}
          <a href="https://www.sky.com/help">Help Homepage</a> and{' '}
          <a href="https://contactus.sky.com">Contact Us</a> as well as backend
          services and CMS&#8217;s that power the help articles and diagnostic
          flows.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          I graduated from{' '}
          <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/">The University of Sheffield</a>{' '}
          in 2015 with a First Class Masters degree in Computer Science. For my
          dissertation, I developed a real-time shadow puppet storytelling
          application using Microsoftâ€™s Kinect sensor and C++.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also worked as a Student Abassador during my final years. This
          involved helping out at open days and events, demonstrating in
          technical activities and giving presentations about life as a student.
