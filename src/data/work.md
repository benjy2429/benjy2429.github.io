I'm currently working as a software developer for [Sky](https://www.sky.com) in Leeds.

I joined through the Software Engineering Academy graduate scheme. This involved a six month project developing a piece of software in an agile team. In our team, we created a digital whiteboard for visualising and orgainising development squads.

These days you'll find me in the Digital Help team programming mainly in ReactJS and Ruby. I deal with frontend apps such as the [Help Homepage](https://www.sky.com/help) and [Contact Us](https://contactus.sky.com) as well as backend services and CMS's that power the help articles and diagnostic flows.
