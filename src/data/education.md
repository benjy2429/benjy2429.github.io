I graduated from [The University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/) in 2015 with a First Class Masters degree in Computer Science. For my dissertation, I developed a real-time shadow puppet storytelling application using Microsoftâ€™s Kinect sensor and C++.

I also worked as a Student Abassador during my final years. This involved helping out at open days and events, demonstrating in technical activities and giving presentations about life as a student.
